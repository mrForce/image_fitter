The point of this program is to take k images, and pack them onto n pages.

It relies on Python Pillow and this library: https://github.com/Mxbonn/strip-packing/

TODO
1) Write a utility that will take an image, with boxes hand-drawn around sections of hand-written notes, and split them up into seperate images
2) Allow user to select sections of PDF files
3) Take one (or more) of the images, and scale theem with different scaling factors, have the user print them out, to derive a maximum scaling factor (the larger the scaling factor, the smaller the image)
4) Do approximate bin packing (right now, I use a greedy heuristic to assign each image to a page, and then run rectangle packing on each page)
5) Implement an exact bin packing algorithm (slower, but more optimal)
